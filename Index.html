<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<p>
    On July 2016 I finished and graduated from my course at University called BSC Computer Animation and Visual Effects. I'm looking for jobs in Animation or Computing as these are my main interests and it would give me the opportunity to further enhance the skills I have learnt from my time at University, College and School.
</p>

<p>

 During my time at University I have developed and used a various amount of techniques and tools. At University and in my free time I have used programs called 3DS Max and Maya to Skin animated characters, model objects, create fluid simulations, animate and create figurative and facial animations. I have used a program called Motionbuilder to edit motion capture data, create key frame animations and import and edit motion capture files. I have used Adobe After Effects to edit film projects and put visual effects into the film. I have also used Photoshop to modify images, create branding material (such as logos, business cards and DVD cases). Furthermore, I've used Photoshop to texture and colour characters that I have created.
</p>

<p>
    Before University I studied IT BTEC Computer Studies Level 3 Extended Diploma. In this course I did Computer Programming, HTML, Java Spreadsheets, Databases and Software Development.
